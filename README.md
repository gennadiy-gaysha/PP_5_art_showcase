### User Stories.

Before initiating the React-based frontend portion of the project, I developed a comprehensive set of 44 user stories to meet the user requirements. Additionally, for the backend, 3 user stories for Admin were created and implemented to allow greater flexibility in database manipulation and for frontend testing purposes. These user stories were subsequently transferred to the Issues and Projects section (Kanban board) of the GitHub repository. Below is a table where all the mentioned user stories are categorized under their respective epics:

### Mockup.

In this project, the React Bootstrap library was implemented. It utilizes a grid system and responsive utility classes, facilitating the creation of a site that looks appealing on both mobile and larger screens without necessarily initiating the design process with a mobile-first approach in mind. Therefore, it was decided not to adhere to the 'mobile-first' approach.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to showcase the appearance of the site on desktop devices and to display the placement of the different elements within the pages.

During the development of the site, minor amendments were made to some initial page designs to enhance user experience (UX)

| Page                   | Desktop version                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Home page (logged out) | ![Desktop log out index wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/index_desktop_logged_out.png)    |
| Home page (logged in)  | ![Desktop log in index wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/index_desktop_logged_in.png)      |
| Log in page            | ![Desktop log in page wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/login_desktop.png)                 |
| Registration page      | ![Desktop sign up page wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/signup_desktop.png)               |
| Painting page          | ![Desktop painting page wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/painting_page_desktop.png)       |
| Add painting page      | ![Desktop add painting wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/add_painting_desktop.png)         |

### React Component Tree.

This project was developed with React, facilitating the reuse of components across the application. React components are versatile, capable of rendering page elements, displaying data, managing events and user interactions, and communicating with other components through props, among other functionalities.

However, as the project grows in size, navigating the file structure and accurately mapping out the relationships between components and containers can become increasingly complex. The expansion of the project can lead to a rapid rise in complexity.

Having a method to visualize the entire project structure by choosing a root component is cost-effective, as it aids in the swift planning and addition of new features, thanks to the insights provided by props.

For the ART SHOWCASE project, a React Component Tree diagram was generated using the [ReacTreeDev](https://reactree.dev/) VS Code plugin and [xMind](https://xmind.app/) tool. This diagram enables a clear visualization of the hierarchical organization of components, highlighting parent/child relationships.

You can also download the original file of the project's React Component Tree diagram from [here](https://github.com/gennadiy-gaysha/PP_5_art_showcase/blob/main/src/assets/App.js.xmind).

### Color Scheme.

The color palette of this site was intentionally chosen to be simple (primarily black and white tones, as well as shades of gray) to keep the user's focus on the images of the paintings.
The color hue table for the project was created using the [Colors](https://coolors.co/).

To provide a complete representation, the first color in the Primary Hue Table (Seasalt) corresponds to the main color of the pattern, which has been
chosen as the background for the entire project.

**Primary color hue table**
![Primary color hue table](/src/assets/readme_images/color_hue_table.png)

**The colors used in the website are as follows:**

- background image for all
  pages: [@lifeforstock](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/abstract-surface-textures-white-concrete-stone-wall_4326138.htm)
- background color for the nav bar and the footer: #ffffff
- logo colors: #ffffff and #000000
- active links and button color: #007bff
- buttons hover color: #2142b2
- main text color: #555
- auxiliary text colors: #c1c1c5, #802222, #ff9254
- icon color: #b5b5b5
- icon hover color: #cfced3

### Topography.

The main Google Font chosen for the project is "DM Sans". To complement it, a variety of FontAwesome icons were deployed to enhance the user experience. Both were imported into the index.html file for use throughout the project. The font link specifies two font weights for DM Sans: 500 (Medium) and 700 (Bold).

## User Permissions.

Given the specific characteristics of this website, I have determined that implementing various levels of permissions/access would significantly enhance both the site's management and the user experience. Below are the different levels of user permissions and authorization rights.

**1. Logged Out User.**

- Access to the Home page, Registration page, Log in Page, and About page
- Use of Footer links to social media accounts
- Use of Painting search and filtering functionality
- Viewing of the Painting detail page
- Ability to read comments in the painting detail page
- Viewing of profile pages of registered users with completed profiles

**2. Logged In User without completed profile.**

- Access to the Home page, Log out page and About page
- Use of Footer links to social media accounts
- Use of Painting search and filtering functionality
- Viewing of the Painting detail page
- Ability to read comments in the painting detail page

3. ## Features

### Navigation Bar (NavBar).

- Includes the main logo, user greeting/username and links to various pages of the site, enhancing the ease of navigation throughout the site.
- The logo image is linked to the home page.
- The NavBar links incorporate a hover effect that changes color, providing users with visual feedback for an improved browsing experience.
- The active (clicked) link on the navigation bar is highlighted in blue.

**Depending on the user status, the NavBar has two different states:**

- For a logged-out (unauthenticated) user:
  ![ArtShowcase Navbar image Authenticated](/src/assets/readme_images/features/nav_unauthenticated.png)
- For a logged-in user:
  ![ArtShowcase Navbar image Unauthenticated](/src/assets/readme_images/features/nav_authenticated.png)

- Responsiveness. NavBar burger menu:

  |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

**Clicking on the avatar/username link may result in two different scenarios, depending on the authenticated user's credentials:**

- For newly registered users who have not completed their profile yet, it activates a modal panel that alerts the user to complete their profile by clicking a button located at the bottom of the panel.
- This Modal Alert panel is also triggered when they click on the "Add Painting", "Faves", and "Watchlist" links on the NavBar.

### Home page.

The Home page features an infinite scroll display of paintings, arranged in rows of three, and includes a set of filters for selecting a desired group of paintings.

![ArtShowcase Home Page image](/src/assets/readme_images/features/home_page.png)

#### **1. Filters area:**

![ArtShowcase Filters Area image](/src/assets/readme_images/features/filters_area.png)

- Search Painting Field

  - Allows users to search for paintings by title or painter's name by entering the relevant information into the field.

- Theme Filter

  - Enables users to find paintings by a desired theme through a dropdown menu. Available options include:
    - Portrait
    - Still Life
    - Landscape
    - Seascape
    - Abstract
    - Figurative
    - Genre
    - Animal

- Technique Filters

  - Users can select paintings by a specific technique using a dropdown menu. Available options are:
    - Oil Paint
    - Acrylic Paint
    - Watercolor
    - Gouache
    - Pastel
    - Charcoal
    - Graphite
    - Ink
    - Mixed Media

- Orientation Filter

  - A computed value filter that helps users to select paintings based on the desired orientation, depending on the painting's width-height ratio. This value can also be chosen from a dropdown menu:
    - Vertical
    - Horizontal
    - Square

- Price Filter

  - A dropdown menu that allows users to sort paintings in _ascending_ or _descending_ order by price.

#### **2. Resetting filter choices.**

- To enhance the user experience, a 'Reset Filters' feature has been implemented. This allows users to quickly and efficiently clear all applied filters by clicking on any of the intuitively obvious links in the NavBar that lead to pages where filters are presented:
  - Logo link
  - Artworks link
  - Faves link
  - Watchlist link

#### **3. Preserving user's filter choices.**

- To improve user convenience, functionality was added to save filter settings in browser's sessionStorage. This keeps filter states preserved across page navigations, ensuring the application remembers users' choices even after navigating away and returning to the PaintingsPage, via links or browser navigation buttons.

- This feature is beneficial for users who wish to view a painting's detail page and then return to the filtered paintings page, among other navigational actions.

#### **4. Painting Card (PaintingList component).**

This component can be divided into four distinct parts, each offering its own functionality.

- Link to the Painting Deatil Page

  - Clicking on any painting on the Paintings Page redirects the user to the [Painting Detail page](#painting-detail-page).

- Avatar/Username

  - Essentially, this acts as a link to the [Profile page](#profile-page) of the user (painting owner).

- Painting Details

  - Provides a summary of information about the painting, as described by the artist upon adding the painting to the gallery.

- Painting Layout

  - Allows the uploading of paintings with any aspect ratio dimensions. Regardless of the aspect ratio, the image will be fitted into a square frame without cropping. Horizontal or vertical images will have padding added on the top and bottom or sides, respectively.

- Observe/Comment Icons and Pop Up Hovered Icon Hints

  - These two icons display the number of times the painting was added to the Watchlist and the number of comments the painting has received, respectively.
  - Depending on whether the painting has been added to their watchlist, the color of the Observe icon changes from blue to grey for the user.
  - Icon hints appear when the user hovers over the Observe (Watch) or Comment icon beneath the painting's data. The type of hint pop-up message displayed varies depending on the user's credentials, as detailed in the table below:

| Status                               | Icon            | Message                                                                | Icon    | Message           |
