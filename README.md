### User Stories.

Before initiating the React-based frontend portion of the project, I developed a comprehensive set of 44 user stories to meet the user requirements. Additionally, for the backend, 3 user stories for Admin were created and implemented to allow greater flexibility in database manipulation and for frontend testing purposes. These user stories were subsequently transferred to the Issues and Projects section (Kanban board) of the GitHub repository. Below is a table where all the mentioned user stories are categorized under their respective epics:

### General structure.

In this project, the React Bootstrap library was implemented. It utilizes a grid system and responsive utility classes, facilitating the creation of a site that looks appealing on both mobile and larger screens without necessarily initiating the design process with a mobile-first approach in mind. Therefore, it was decided not to adhere to the 'mobile-first' approach.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to showcase the appearance of the site on desktop devices and to display the placement of the different elements within the pages.

During the development of the site, minor amendments were made to some initial page designs to enhance user experience (UX)

| Page                   | Desktop version                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Home page (logged out) | ![Desktop log out index wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/index_desktop_logged_out.png)    |
| Home page (logged in)  | ![Desktop log in index wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/index_desktop_logged_in.png)      |
| Log in page            | ![Desktop log in page wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/login_desktop.png)                 |
| Registration page      | ![Desktop sign up page wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/signup_desktop.png)               |
| Painting page          | ![Desktop painting page wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/painting_page_desktop.png)       |
| Add painting page      | ![Desktop add painting wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/add_painting_desktop.png)         |
| Profile page           | ![Desktop profile page wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/profile_page_desktop.png)         |
| Complete profile page  | ![Desktop complete profile wireframe image](/src/assets/readme_images/wireframes/complete_profile_desktop.png) |

### React Component Tree.

This project was developed with React, facilitating the reuse of components across the application. React components are versatile, capable of rendering page elements, displaying data, managing events and user interactions, and communicating with other components through props, among other functionalities.

However, as the project grows in size, navigating the file structure and accurately mapping out the relationships between components and containers can become increasingly complex. The expansion of the project can lead to a rapid rise in complexity.

Having a method to visualize the entire project structure by choosing a root component is cost-effective, as it aids in the swift planning and addition of new features, thanks to the insights provided by props.

For the ART SHOWCASE project, a React Component Tree diagram was generated using the [ReacTreeDev](https://reactree.dev/) VS Code plugin and [xMind](https://xmind.app/) tool. This diagram enables a clear visualization of the hierarchical organization of components, highlighting parent/child relationships.

You can also download the original file of the project's React Component Tree diagram from
`/src/assets/App.js.xmind` in this project.

### Color Scheme

The color palette of this site was intentionally chosen to be simple (primarily black and white tones, as well as shades of gray) to keep the user's focus on the images of the paintings.
The color hue table for the project was created using the [Colors](https://coolors.co/).

To provide a complete representation, the first color in the Primary Hue Table (Seasalt) corresponds to the main color of the pattern, which has been
chosen as the background for the entire project.

**Primary color hue table**
![Primary color hue table](/src/assets/readme_images/color_hue_table.png)

**The colors used in the website are as follows:**

- background image for all
  pages: [@lifeforstock](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/abstract-surface-textures-white-concrete-stone-wall_4326138.htm)
- background color for the nav bar and the footer: #ffffff
- logo colors: #ffffff and #000000
- active links and button color: #007bff
- buttons hover color: #2142b2
- main text color: #555
- auxiliary text colors: #c1c1c5, #802222, #ff9254
- icon color: #b5b5b5
- icon hover color: #cfced3

### Topography

The main Google Font chosen for the project is "DM Sans". To complement it, a variety of FontAwesome icons were deployed to enhance the user experience. Both were imported into the index.html file for use throughout the project. The font link specifies two font weights for DM Sans: 500 (Medium) and 700 (Bold).
